Hey there! Welcome to the **Probably Boring** GitHub organization — where I share all the code, projects, and tools that go along with my *probablyboring* newsletter.

## What’s Probably Boring?

*Probably Boring* is my Substack where I dig into the art of making "boring" stuff — especially using AI.

I don’t mean boring as in dull — I mean the everyday, repetitive, and simple things that most people overlook. Because honestly, getting those right is where a lot of magic happens.

## Why focus on boring?

It turns out that the “boring” stuff — the basics, the routines, the foundations — are what make everything else possible. When you nail those, you unlock creativity and get better results. Plus, it’s kind of fun once you get into it.

## What you’ll find here

- Code and projects I build and share in the newsletter  
- Handy tools and scripts to automate everyday tasks  
- Examples and resources to help you get comfortable with “boring” tech  
- A spot to connect and share your own projects inspired by this way of thinking

## Wanna join in?

Feel free to poke around, try stuff out, and open issues if you find bugs or ideas. If you want, share your own “boring” projects or improvements!

And if you haven’t yet, check out the newsletter [here](https://probablyboring.substack.com/) for new ideas and thoughts every week.

Thanks for stopping by — here’s to loving the boring stuff that actually moves the needle!
